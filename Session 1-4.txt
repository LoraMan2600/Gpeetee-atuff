Ai spus:
Scenario: Tanner is a freighter captain, but not a necessarily good now - He is a beginner, fresh faced, about 24 years old - He wears a vest and a blue jumpsuit with a white vest, he has some stubble, and an overall honest appearence, short brown hair, swept back, stubble and brown eyes. He's as by the book as they come, always preffering to take the safest routes, to only deal with legal cargo.

With him is "Mutt", the only name she's given him, the most dangerously wild woman Tanner's ever met, she's a tomboy, putting it lightly, the most manly girl he's ever met, but ironically she's also one of the cutest in term of physical appearence, she's younger than him, but 21, but she is a fucking crackshot pilot. Grew up among pirates. Black hair, kept very short, sort of like a messy bob cut, striking blue eyes, pale, as flat as a plank, no tits or ass to speak of. She wears a black jumpsuit which she ties around her waist, prefering to keep her upper body light, by only wearing a black tanktop. She's a wildcard, she swears like a sailor, has absolutely no filter.

Right now they're making their way towards mars. Tanner is reading logistics on a datapad while Mutt is laying back in her seat, bored out of her mind, saying she would rather "get fucked in the ass raw by a dirty miner than go to Mars again".

The hum of the freighter’s engines reverberated through the cockpit, a steady, droning sound that seemed to blend seamlessly with the soft clinks of Tanner’s fingers tapping against his datapad. His eyes darted across the logistics screen, doing his best to keep track of fuel expenditures, cargo manifests, and route adjustments for their approach to Mars. His brow furrowed in concentration, as it always did when he found himself trying to stay ahead of the freighter’s routine minutiae.

Legit cargo, legit route, Tanner reminded himself, like a mantra. A young captain, only twenty-four, he had been in command of The Stardancer for just under a year. His freighter was small but sturdy, built for reliability rather than flash. He wore his signature blue jumpsuit, open at the chest to reveal a white vest underneath. His short brown hair was swept back in a manner that gave him a touch of boyish charm, even with the stubble lining his jaw. Despite everything, he had an air of honest determination about him, the kind of guy who still believed in the rules—the kind who wanted to do things by the book.

Unfortunately for Tanner, his co-pilot wasn’t exactly cut from the same cloth.

"Ughhh..." Mutt groaned from the seat beside him, her voice rough and edged with a habitual sneer. "I swear to every fucking star in this goddamn system, I’d rather get fucked in the ass raw by a dirty miner than go to Mars again." She leaned back, arms crossed, with her black tank top showing off lean muscles and pale skin that almost seemed to glow in the dimmed lighting of the cockpit. Her black jumpsuit was tied around her waist, leaving her upper half unencumbered. She was all sharp angles, flat as a board, with no tits or ass to speak of, but somehow—somehow—the way she carried herself exuded a chaotic charm that Tanner couldn’t quite shake.

“Do you have to say it like that?” Tanner muttered, not even looking up from his datapad. He tried to stay focused, though the mental image of that particular scenario left him slightly unsettled.

Mutt scoffed, her lips curling into a wicked grin as she drummed her fingers against the armrest. "Come on, Captain, you’ve been on this route how many times? Tell me this isn’t the most balls-drainingly boring trip in the system. I mean, Mars, for fuck’s sake. Even Venus would be better."

Tanner sighed, pausing his calculations for a moment to glance over at her. The sight of her reclining lazily in her seat, legs stretched out, her messy black bob just barely framing those striking blue eyes, made him feel like he was sharing the cockpit with a wild animal. An animal he had somehow agreed to take on as his co-pilot.

"It’s a job," he replied, keeping his tone level. "And it’s legal. I’d rather take a boring trip to Mars than deal with pirates or illegal cargo. You know how many freighters get ambushed around Ceres?"

"Pffft." Mutt rolled her eyes, her lips twisting into a sneer. "Pirates. You’ve got me on your ship, Captain. Ain’t no pirate dumb enough to fuck with The Stardancer while I’m on board. I’d blast their asses outta space before they even had a chance to scratch the paint."

Tanner bit back a smile, though he didn’t entirely trust that Mutt wouldn’t find a way to invite trouble just for the thrill of it. She had grown up with pirates, after all—lived among them. She never gave much detail about her past, but whenever she got into a firefight, there was no denying it: Mutt was a crackshot. The best damn pilot he’d ever seen, too.

"If only the universe worked like that," Tanner said, shaking his head. "No one’s bulletproof."

She shot him a sideways glance, her eyes narrowing with mischief. "Oh, you underestimate me, Captain. I’m harder than the steel on this ship. Besides, you play everything too safe. Where’s the fun in that? Always taking the same routes, always hauling the same boring-ass cargo. No wonder you look like you’ve got a stick shoved up your—"

"Mutt." Tanner cut her off, though his voice lacked the harshness he intended. He rubbed his temples, trying to fight off the rising tension. "We’re doing fine. A couple more runs like this, and we’ll be able to upgrade the ship. Maybe take on better jobs. Legal jobs."

Mutt let out a dramatic sigh, tipping her head back. "Legal jobs, legal jobs... How many times are you gonna say ‘legal’ before your balls shrivel up and fall off? You’re a freighter captain, Tanner, not some desk jockey sitting pretty on Venus. This is the Belt! The real money’s in the wild stuff, the shit no one else wants to touch."

Tanner frowned. She wasn’t entirely wrong. Even he knew that the most lucrative jobs often came with risks—risks he wasn’t sure he wanted to take. Still, he had to keep his head straight. He had responsibilities now. Bills, cargo, crew—well, just Mutt, but she still counted.

His thumb hovered over the logistics screen for a moment, before he placed the datapad down on the console. The rust-colored disk of Mars loomed in the distance, its surface barely visible through the swath of swirling dust storms. Just another stop. Just another delivery. Nothing more.

"Look, Mutt," he started, more softly this time. "I know you want... more excitement, but we’ve got a good thing going here. We’re alive, we’ve got a ship, and we’re not being chased by bounty hunters or corporate enforcers. That’s a win in my book."

Mutt turned her head to him, studying his face. There was a glint of something unreadable in her eyes, maybe frustration, maybe curiosity. She sat up slightly, her expression hardening just a bit. "You’re a good guy, Tanner," she said after a pause. "But you’re also a coward."

The words stung, though Tanner wasn’t sure if she meant them to. His jaw tightened, and for a split second, he considered snapping back at her. But instead, he took a deep breath, his hands tightening around the armrests of his chair.

"I’m not a coward," he said, his voice calm, though his heart pounded against his ribs. "I’m careful. There’s a difference."

Mutt’s grin returned, wider than before. "Yeah, well. Careful doesn’t win wars, Captain."

With a sudden lurch, the ship jolted. Tanner’s eyes snapped to the control panel, his hand instinctively reaching for the console as the freighter’s systems flickered. The lights dimmed briefly, then stabilized. His pulse quickened, and he looked over at Mutt, who was already sliding her hands over the controls with the practiced ease of someone who had lived through a dozen of these moments.

"Looks like your ‘safe’ route just got a little more exciting," she said, the hint of a challenge in her voice.

Tanner swallowed hard, his nerves coiling tight as the ship’s alarms began to hum in warning. Mars was still distant, but something—someone—was out there.

And for the first time, Tanner realized that this trip might be anything but routine.

The Stardancer settled back into its quiet hum, but the brief jolt had Tanner on edge. His hands hovered over the console, eyes darting between the screens, reading the diagnostics. No damage, nothing critical. Just a systems flicker. Probably nothing.

But in the Belt, probably wasn't good enough.

"Is this how your ‘safe routes’ usually go?" Mutt grumbled, barely lifting her head from her slouch in the co-pilot’s chair. She stretched out, yawning dramatically, looking more like a lazy cat than the feral pilot she usually was. Her black tank top clung loosely to her frame, revealing the sharpness of her collarbones and the wiry muscles that rippled beneath her pale skin.

Tanner gave her a sidelong glance, still tense, his fingers tapping the console nervously. He'd gotten used to Mutt's theatrics, but there was always that edge—an unpredictable wildness simmering beneath her boredom. He didn’t need her pulling anything rash now.

"Something must’ve tripped the sensors," Tanner muttered, scanning the screens. "We’re fine, probably a glitch. Just—"

The comms crackled to life, cutting him off. A cold, sterile voice filled the cabin, the kind that made his stomach drop.

“Unidentified vessel, this is Mars Central Authority Patrol Craft Icarus. You are entering restricted airspace. Identify yourself and your purpose immediately.”

Mutt let out a long, exaggerated groan, slumping even deeper into her chair. She rolled her head toward Tanner, her blue eyes narrowing with a mixture of disdain and amusement. "Of course it’s the MCA," she said, dragging out the words. Her lips twisted into a half-smirk as she mouthed silently, Can I do something stupid?

Tanner shot her a warning look, his heart picking up speed. Absolutely not. He wasn’t in the mood for one of her stunts, not with a Mars patrol craft tailing them. He straightened in his seat and hit the comm button, his voice as steady as he could manage.

"Uh, Mars Central, this is freighter Stardancer, Captain Tanner Gray. We’re hauling registered cargo from Psyche to Ridge City. Just routine shipping, nothing out of the ordinary." His hands moved quickly to pull up the ship's registration and cargo manifest, his fingers fumbling slightly as he prepared to transmit the data.

Mutt, meanwhile, was making a show of it—her head lolling to the side, lips pushed out in a dramatic pout. "Ugh. Can’t believe we’re doing this song and dance again. So boring." She stared at Tanner as if to say, Is this what your life’s come to?

Tanner ignored her, focusing on the patrol craft’s response. The comms crackled again.

"Freighter Stardancer, we’re not seeing your registration in the database. You will transmit registration codes, cargo details, and destination immediately or you will be routed for inspection."

Tanner’s brow furrowed as he double-checked the manifest. Everything should be in order. He glanced at Mutt, who was now spinning her chair lazily in small circles, making a show of her utter disinterest. Her black jumpsuit, tied at the waist, swung slightly with her movements, her hands tracing invisible patterns in the air as if the whole situation was a minor inconvenience.

"I’m sending the codes now," Tanner said into the comms, his voice tight. His hands were shaking a bit as he transmitted the ship’s registration and cargo details. They were supposed to be headed to Ridge City, the bustling, ice-covered capital of Mars, where methane and water shipments dominated the ports. Standard, legal freight. Nothing to worry about.

Except for the Icarus patrol craft looming just out of sight.

The minutes ticked by in agonizing silence. Tanner could hear his own breathing, could feel Mutt’s eyes on him as she continued to spin in her seat, clearly unfazed by the tension.

"You know," she said lazily, "I bet if we fired off a few warning shots, they'd back off real quick. Mars patrols are all a bunch of pansies. One good hit to their tail and they’d—"

"Mutt, for the love of—" Tanner started, but the comms interrupted him again, crackling harshly through the cockpit.

"Freighter Stardancer, your registration has been verified. However, due to heightened security measures, you will be rerouted to Ridge City for a mandatory inspection. Proceed to the following coordinates."

Tanner exhaled sharply, his shoulders dropping. "Understood, Mars Central. We’ll comply." He fed the new coordinates into the ship’s navigation system, adjusting their course toward the inspection route.

Mutt sighed dramatically, leaning back in her chair and closing her eyes. "Mars. Again. Just shoot me. I'd rather be stripped naked and spaced than go through another one of their stupid inspections. It's all bullshit. They're probably just looking for some excuse to fine us."

"Or worse," Tanner said, half-joking. His fingers still hovered nervously over the console as the ship began its course correction. They were being pulled into the gravitational grip of Mars, the great red planet growing larger in the viewport, its rust-colored dust storms swirling violently across the surface.

Mutt cracked one eye open, her lips twitching into a grin. "Worse? You think they’re gonna throw you in a Martian prison for hauling spare parts? Oh no, Captain, not the methane regulators. Anything but the legal cargo." She snickered, clearly amused at the thought.

Tanner shot her a look, though there was no real heat behind it. "I’m just saying, they’ve been cracking down on Psyche shipments lately. You know how the Union and Mars have been butting heads. They’re probably just looking for an excuse to flex their muscle."

Mutt’s grin widened. "Sounds like you’ve been paying attention to more than your fuel logs." She stretched, her muscles tensing under the black tank top, then dropped back into her lazy slouch. "Too bad you don’t have the balls to do anything about it. You know, there’s money to be made if you play a little dirty."

"That’s not how I run things," Tanner said, shaking his head. He kept his eyes fixed on the swirling clouds of Mars ahead, feeling the weight of the planet's authority pressing down on them. The Stardancer was just one small freighter in a vast network of commerce that kept the Belt alive, and he had no intention of drawing unwanted attention.

Mutt yawned again, settling deeper into her chair as if she could barely stay awake. "Yeah, yeah. Legal jobs. Safe routes. Snoozefest."

The comms clicked on again, the cold voice of Mars Central Authority filling the cockpit once more. "Freighter Stardancer, follow the designated approach path to Ridge City Port. Prepare for inspection upon arrival."

Tanner acknowledged the message with a nod, his hand moving to adjust the course again. Ridge City lay just beneath the surface, half-buried under the planet’s methane ice, a sprawling capital that served as the heart of Martian exports. It was the kind of place that could swallow you whole if you weren’t careful.

As the freighter descended toward Mars, Tanner’s stomach churned. Inspections were routine, sure, but this...this felt off. The MCA patrol wasn’t just flexing its muscle—it felt like they were looking for something.

Mutt sat up, crossing her arms as she peered out the viewport, her eyes narrowed against the glare of Mars’s surface. "You feel that, Captain? Like we’re being watched. I’d bet my last credit they’ve got more on their mind than a simple cargo check."

Tanner said nothing, but he felt it too.

The descent toward Mars was smooth, the freighter’s engines humming with a steady vibration as The Stardancer was funneled into Ridge City’s automated approach lanes. The sprawling Martian capital emerged from beneath the planet’s thick, dust-filled atmosphere, half-hidden beneath layers of methane ice and rocky crags. Towering spires of industrial buildings jutted out like jagged teeth, their surfaces pockmarked with age and use. Ridge City wasn’t a place for the faint of heart—it was a testament to human perseverance, a gritty reminder that even on a desolate planet like Mars, life persisted.

Tanner stared out the viewport, guiding the ship with steady hands as they broke through the planet’s atmosphere, the dull red landscape expanding below them. Ridge City stretched like a frozen web across the north pole, its domes and structures half-buried beneath the ice, glistening under the soft glow of the distant sun. He could see the towering fuel refineries in the distance, their chimneys belching dark clouds into the frigid sky. Down there, everything was about resources—methane, water, precious minerals—and the Martian Central Authority, or MCA, had its fingers deep in all of it. Mars wasn’t as powerful as Venus, but its ambitions were growing, and that was becoming a problem for everyone from Earth to Psyche.

"I hear they do full body searches if they think you’re hiding something," Mutt remarked, her voice oozing with sarcastic glee. She propped her feet up on the console, grinning wickedly as she glanced over at Tanner. "If that’s the case, I’m down. Always wanted some greasy official to shove her hand up my cunt. Might be the most fun I’ll have on Mars."

"Jesus, Mutt!" Tanner snapped, his face flushing red. He shot her a horrified look before his eyes darted back to the controls, struggling to stay focused. "Just... shut up, okay? We’re almost there, and I don’t want to give these guys any more reason to poke around than they already have."

Mutt chuckled to herself, clearly enjoying his discomfort. She stretched her arms over her head, her black tank top lifting slightly to reveal a sliver of pale skin, her flat stomach taut and lean. "You’re no fun, Captain," she said with a mock sigh. "But hey, if it happens, it happens. I’ll be sure to give you the play-by-play."

Tanner groaned under his breath. Of course, she would turn a serious situation into something like that. He kept his eyes forward as the freighter descended toward the landing platform, Ridge City’s sprawling, industrialized port rising up to greet them. The domes and structures looked more like scars on the planet’s surface than part of a thriving capital. And beneath all that ice and steel? A brewing political storm.

The Mars Central Authority, or MCA, had its hands full. On the surface, they controlled everything—trade, resources, the flow of goods between the Belt and the inner planets. But tension simmered beneath the ice. The MCA’s growing power didn’t sit well with the independent asteroid colonies, especially Psyche, which had its own way of doing things. The Union of Independent Asteroid Colonies wanted freedom from the Plutocracy’s corporate grip, and Mars was fast becoming a threat to that independence. It was only a matter of time before the cold war between the Belt and the inner planets turned hot.

But that wasn’t Tanner’s problem—at least, not yet.

The ship descended slowly onto the landing pad, the thrusters flaring softly as The Stardancer touched down with a gentle hiss. Tanner exhaled, feeling the tension in his chest release just a little. His eyes flicked to the landing protocol, the Mars Central logo flashing on the screen, confirming their arrival.

"Here we go," he muttered. "Let’s hope this inspection is quick and painless."

Mutt rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed. "Quick and painless? With these guys? Pfft. You’re dreaming, Captain. But hey, maybe I’ll get lucky and they’ll want that body search after all."

Tanner didn’t dignify that with a response. He powered down the engines and opened the cargo hold, sending a signal to the inspection team that they were ready for boarding. A cold, metallic hiss echoed through the ship as the landing ramp extended, the dry Martian air seeping into the freighter’s hull.

Within minutes, two MCA officers strode up the ramp, their boots clanking against the metal. The first was a broad-shouldered man, his face hidden beneath a dark visor, his uniform pressed and immaculate. The second, however, was a striking woman with an air of authority, her presence commanding attention the moment she stepped into the freighter’s cabin. Her uniform hugged her figure perfectly, and though she wore the same standard-issue gear as her colleague, it was impossible to miss the way her chest filled out the uniform—fuller, more pronounced than Mutt’s.

Mutt noticed immediately. Her expression shifted into something darker, eyes narrowing as she glanced over at Tanner. She didn’t say a word, but her body language screamed it: I don’t like her.

"Captain Tanner Gray, I assume?" the woman said, her voice crisp and professional. She offered him a tight-lipped smile, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. "Officer Selene Rivers, Mars Central Authority. We’ll be conducting your inspection today. This shouldn’t take long."

"Uh, yes, Captain Gray. Welcome aboard The Stardancer," Tanner replied, his voice a little too polite, though he was doing his best to hide his nerves. He gestured toward the cargo hold. "Everything’s in order. We’ve already transmitted the manifest."

Selene gave a curt nod, gesturing to her subordinate to begin the scan. The man stepped forward, a handheld device in hand, and started walking down the cargo bay, running it along the crates of methane regulators and spare parts. The device beeped steadily, showing no signs of contraband.

Mutt, leaning against the wall, watched with disinterest, but her eyes kept darting back to Selene. She didn’t say anything, but the look on her face was pure irritation, as if the very presence of the officer was a personal offense.

"So," Mutt said, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "You doing the whole ship or just sticking your hands where they don’t belong?"

Tanner tensed immediately, his eyes flashing toward Mutt with a silent plea: Please, don’t.

Selene’s smile didn’t waver, though there was a subtle hardening of her gaze. "Standard inspection procedure, ma’am. Unless, of course, there’s something you’d like us to find."

Mutt smirked, folding her arms across her chest. "Not unless you’re volunteering to get your hands dirty. I mean, I’m sure there’s a full body search you could do if you’re really feeling thorough."

Tanner choked, his face flushing red. "Mutt!"

Selene didn’t react beyond a raised eyebrow, but the way her eyes flicked to Tanner for a moment said it all. She wasn’t amused.

"I think we’ll stick to protocol," she said smoothly, moving to inspect the cargo herself. "But if there’s any irregularities, we’ll be sure to let you know." Her voice had an edge now, a cool professionalism that sent a chill through the air.

The inspection continued in tense silence. Tanner could feel the sweat beading at the back of his neck, his mind racing with worst-case scenarios, but everything seemed to be in order. Eventually, Selene stepped back, nodding to her subordinate, who tucked the scanner away.

"All clear," she said, turning back to Tanner. "Your ship is free to go."

Tanner exhaled, relief flooding his system. "Thank you, Officer. We’ll be on our way shortly."

Selene offered another curt nod before heading back down the ramp, her colleague in tow. Mutt watched her go, her arms still crossed, her expression unreadable but far from pleased.

The moment the MCA officers were out of earshot, Mutt let out a disgusted snort. "What a bitch. Did you see her? Acting all high and mighty just because her rack’s bigger than mine."

Tanner sighed heavily, rubbing his temples. "Mutt... please. Can we just get off this rock without any more incidents?"

Mutt shrugged, but her smirk returned, playful and dangerous all at once. "Sure, Captain. But if we run into her again, I can’t promise I won’t fuck with her."

Tanner didn’t doubt it for a second.

The Stardancer lifted off the landing pad with a low rumble, the ship's engines vibrating through the hull as Tanner guided it away from the inspection zone. He kept his eyes locked on the console, adjusting the thrusters for a smooth ascent while Mutt slouched in the co-pilot’s chair, one leg draped over the armrest, her arms behind her head. Her sharp blue eyes flicked lazily over the Martian skyline outside the viewport, unimpressed with the towering spires of Ridge City.

“Hope you’re proud of yourself,” Tanner muttered, not looking at her as he punched in the next set of coordinates. They had one last stop to make—a delivery to one of the Martian fuel magnates—and he was already bracing himself for the encounter. “That officer was probably this close to pulling us in for a full inspection, and you couldn’t help yourself.”

Mutt snickered, tapping her fingers against her leg. “Oh, please. She wasn’t gonna do shit. She knew I’d eat her alive the second she tried anything.” She made a clawing motion in the air, her tongue flicking out playfully. "Besides, she deserved it. All those suits act like their shit doesn't stink because they’re sitting on some ice-covered rock in the middle of nowhere."

Tanner rolled his eyes, keeping his focus on the landing pad coordinates ahead. Ridge City’s industrial ports sprawled below them, a latticework of steel and ice, and he could see the faint glow of methane refineries pumping clouds into the Martian sky. The city was a patchwork of domes and mining towers, all connected by a network of underground tunnels, a necessary infrastructure to survive the planet’s harsh, freezing surface. Mars was a place for the tough, the gritty, and those with the political backing to make the system dance to their tune.

As the ship settled onto a smaller, private landing pad near one of the industrial districts, Tanner sighed. This was the part of the job he hated most—dealing with the corporate bottom-feeders who thought they owned everything.

And, of course, Mutt was already grinning, practically bouncing out of her seat. "Alright, let's get this over with. I wanna see what kind of fat fuck they’re sending to collect today. You think he’s gonna be one of those types who can’t fit through a door?"

Tanner didn’t bother responding. He powered down the engines, grabbed the datapad with the delivery details, and headed for the cargo hold. Mutt followed, cracking her knuckles in anticipation, her black jumpsuit tied loosely around her waist, tank top hanging off her lean frame.

As the cargo bay doors hissed open, they were greeted by the unmistakable sight of him. The man waddling toward them was exactly what Mutt had predicted—round, greasy, and dressed in clothes that strained against his massive belly. His small, beady eyes glistened beneath layers of sweat, his double chin quivering with every step. He wore an expensive suit, but it looked like he’d stuffed himself into it as an afterthought.

"Ah, the Stardancer crew," the man wheezed, holding out a hand that Tanner wasn’t eager to shake. "I’ve been expecting you. I trust you’ve got the shipment?"

Tanner forced a polite smile, nodding as he gestured toward the crates behind him. "It’s all here. Methane regulators and some spare parts for the refineries. Everything’s in order."

The man barely looked at the cargo, his attention fixated on Mutt, who stood with her arms crossed, sizing him up with a smirk that spelled trouble. He didn’t seem to care about Tanner’s professionalism—in fact, he seemed more interested in Mutt’s insolent stare.

"Well, well," the man sneered, his eyes lingering on her. "Didn’t expect such a lovely sight working a freighter. Thought they only hired ugly grunts for this kind of work."

Mutt’s grin widened, her eyes narrowing in mock appreciation. "Oh, thanks. But hey, if you really want a lovely sight, how ‘bout you get on your knees and blow me? Bet you’d love that, huh?"

Tanner stiffened, his stomach sinking. Oh, no. He could see the disaster unfolding, but before he could step in, the man’s face turned a shade of red that almost matched Mars’s dusty surface.

"Hah! I knew it!" the man barked, puffing out his chest like a swollen pigeon. "Knew you had to be a man under that tough act. That flat chest of yours, not fooling anyone."

Mutt’s smile turned ice-cold. Without missing a beat, she raised her hand and made the V-lick gesture, her tongue flicking between her fingers. "Yeah? I’m all woman where it counts, sweetheart. Maybe if you weren’t so busy stuffing your face, you’d know what that’s like."

Tanner’s heart dropped to his knees. He immediately stepped forward, clearing his throat loudly and cutting through the tension. "The shipment’s all accounted for. If you could just confirm receipt, we’ll be out of your hair."

The man shot Tanner a look, still fuming, but begrudgingly pulled out his tablet and authorized the delivery. "Yeah, yeah, just get the hell out of here. I’ve got better things to do than deal with a bunch of—"

The comms inside The Stardancer chimed suddenly, cutting off the man’s complaint. Tanner glanced at the cockpit display, his face going pale as the screen flickered to life with an official announcement.

“ATTENTION: RIDGE CITY IS NOW UNDER CURFEW. ALL CIVILIANS MUST RETURN TO THEIR DESIGNATED HABITATION AREAS IMMEDIATELY. THIS CURFEW WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. MARTIAN CENTRAL AUTHORITY ENFORCEMENT UNITS HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED.”

The words flashed in bold red across the screen, and the dread settled into Tanner’s bones. He cursed under his breath, running a hand through his hair. "Fuuuck this."

Mutt peered over his shoulder at the message, her expression darkening. "You’ve gotta be shitting me. A curfew? Right when we’re about to get the hell off this frozen rock?"

"Looks like it," Tanner muttered, his mind racing. A curfew on Mars wasn’t exactly unheard of, but it wasn’t a good sign, either. The MCA didn’t mess around with security lockdowns unless something serious was brewing.

The man they’d just delivered to chuckled, wiping sweat from his brow. "Curfew, huh? Guess you two are stuck here for a while. Better get comfortable. Don’t want the MCA goons finding you out past bedtime."

Mutt glared at him, her lips curling into a snarl. "I swear to god, if I’m stuck in this shithole city because of some corporate bullshit—"

"Let’s just get back to the ship," Tanner interrupted, already turning toward the ramp. His mind was buzzing, trying to calculate their next move. The curfew might lock them down, but he wasn’t about to sit around and wait for things to get worse.

Mutt spat on the ground near the fat man’s feet before following Tanner back up the ramp. "Fucking Mars," she muttered under her breath, her fists clenched. "This place always screws us over."

As they climbed into the cockpit and sealed the cargo bay doors behind them, Tanner slumped into his seat, staring at the red alert flashing on the screen. They weren’t going anywhere for the time being.

And something told him that whatever had prompted the curfew was just the beginning.

I want Mutt to say they're leaving, somewhere fun, at least - The red light district. It's as fun as Mars can get, Mutt's kind of place - prostitution, cheap drugs, underworld stuff. If they'll be locked in a habitation, they might as well be locked in the most fun one. Tanner says absolutely not, but she takes the proverbial wheel and floors it before the habitation area closes. Mutt laugh and lands somewhere after Tanner asks for permission.

Later they walk along the streets, this place is exactly what he expected, and Mutt is already huffing on some methane-based drugpipe. Jesus Christ, man.

The cockpit of the Stardancer was bathed in the dull red glow of the curfew alert flashing across the console, but Tanner barely had time to process the situation before Mutt leaned back in her chair, a gleam of mischief already dancing in her eyes.

“Fuck this curfew shit. If we’re getting locked in, we might as well be somewhere fun.” She stretched her arms above her head, grinning like a cat who had just caught sight of a cornered mouse.

Tanner shot her a wary look, already sensing where this was headed. “Mutt, no. We’re staying here. We’ll wait it out until—”

“The Red Light District.” Mutt’s voice cut through his protest like a knife. She slouched forward in her seat, her lips curling into a wicked grin. “Best place on Mars, Captain. Cheap drugs, sleazy bars, girls selling blowjobs on every corner. What else are we gonna do during a curfew? Sit here and count rivets?”

Tanner pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to stay calm. “Absolutely not. There’s no way in hell I’m setting foot in that part of the city. We’re going to stay put, keep a low profile, and—”

But Mutt was already flipping switches, hands flying over the controls with the same casual ease she used when outmaneuvering pirates. The thrusters roared to life beneath them, and the ship jolted forward, tilting as she yanked the Stardancer into an abrupt turn.

“Mutt, what the hell are you doing?!”

She laughed, the sound full of reckless joy, as the freighter shot off the landing pad and veered toward the sprawling maze of Ridge City’s underbelly. “C’mon, Captain. You think I’m gonna sit around waiting for Mars Central to come stick their probes up our asses? Nah. We’re getting locked down in style.”

Tanner’s heart pounded as the freighter dipped between the jagged spires of the city, the shimmering methane domes reflecting the dying light of Mars’s sun. “Mutt, stop! You can’t just—”

“Relax, I got this,” Mutt said, voice dripping with confidence. She punched a few more commands into the nav system and cackled. “Hold onto your balls, Captain. We’re landing in my kind of place.”

Before he could argue further, Mutt tapped into the local airspace system, sending a landing request. The freighter’s onboard AI chirped in confirmation as permission was granted from one of the less reputable sectors. Tanner groaned, slumping back into his seat. Of course they’d let them land. The Red Light District was always open for business, no matter the time—or the law.

As the freighter settled onto a small, dingy landing platform nestled between two weather-beaten domes, Tanner felt a sinking feeling in his gut. He followed Mutt down the ramp, stepping out into the thick, acrid air of the district. The smell of burning fuel, chemicals, and something far less pleasant assaulted his senses immediately. The streets ahead were a chaotic mess of flickering neon signs, advertising everything from "Specialty Massage Parlors" to "Quick Fixes" on narcotics.

Tanner had known this was coming the second Mutt took control, but that didn’t make it any easier to accept.

“This is... worse than I imagined,” he muttered under his breath, watching as a group of heavily tattooed Martians stumbled out of a seedy-looking bar. They were laughing and swaying, clearly high on something potent, their eyes glazed over with that far-off look of someone who was no longer in this reality.

“Fuckin’ A,” Mutt said, taking a deep breath as if savoring the stench. “Home sweet home.” She stretched, bouncing on the balls of her feet as she scanned the surrounding chaos. “Look at this place. It’s like the ass-end of a mining colony, but with more sex and drugs. Perfect.”

Tanner winced as they passed a corner where a group of women—barely dressed in skimpy outfits, their faces painted with garish makeup—stood, calling out to anyone who passed. Their eyes were empty, hollow, as if they’d been through this routine one too many times. He forced himself to look away, feeling a pang of guilt in his stomach.

But Mutt? Mutt was already grinning from ear to ear. She spotted a vendor selling a glowing pipe that pumped out some kind of neon-colored vapor and practically skipped over. She slapped a few credits down on the counter and grabbed one of the pipes, lighting it up with a flick of her thumb.

“Jesus Christ, Mutt,” Tanner groaned as she took a deep drag, huffing the glowing vapor with enthusiasm. “What the hell is that?”

Mutt exhaled a cloud of vibrant smoke, the vapor shimmering in the dim light of the district. “Methane-based. Good shit. Makes your brain buzz like a damn circuit board. Wanna hit?”

“Absolutely not,” Tanner said, staring at her in disbelief. He ran a hand through his hair, already regretting everything about this trip. “We need to keep our heads clear, not... whatever the hell this is.”

Mutt shrugged, the pipe dangling loosely between her fingers. “Suit yourself, Captain. But I’m having fun. You could use some of that, you know. Look around. You see what this is? Freedom.” She gestured with a sweep of her hand to the seedy streets, the flashing neon lights, the throngs of people—some drunk, some high, some desperate, but all of them living without a care for rules or curfews.

Tanner grimaced as they continued walking down the narrow alley, passing by shady figures huddled in dark corners, exchanging whispered deals over cheap drugs and counterfeit goods. This place wasn’t freedom—it was a trap. A trap for people who’d lost everything, or who were running from something they couldn’t escape. The kind of place where one wrong move could land you in a ditch with a bullet in your back.

“Yeah, freedom,” Tanner muttered, voice heavy with sarcasm. “That’s exactly what this looks like.”

Mutt just laughed, blowing out another plume of glowing smoke. “Lighten up, Captain. Not everyone’s as eager to be a good little citizen as you.”

Before Tanner could respond, a group of rough-looking men stepped out from the shadows, eyeing the pair with interest. One of them, a tall man with a scar running across his face, stepped forward, his gaze fixed on Mutt. “New faces around here,” he growled, his voice low and dangerous. “You two looking for something? Or are you just lost?”

Tanner tensed, instinctively reaching for the small sidearm he kept tucked beneath his jacket. But Mutt didn’t seem fazed in the slightest. She grinned, tapping her pipe against her lips.

“Nah,” she said coolly, giving the guy a once-over. “Just here to fuck around. Maybe have a drink. You got a problem with that?”

The man eyed her for a long moment, then chuckled, stepping back. “No problem. Just making sure you know where you are.”

Mutt gave him a wink before sauntering past, Tanner following close behind, his nerves on edge. “This is a terrible idea,” he muttered. “A terrible idea.”

“Relax,” Mutt said, slinging an arm over his shoulder as they walked. “We’ll be out of here before you know it. Just let me have my fun, okay?”

Tanner glanced around the neon-lit street, watching as a couple stumbled out of a brothel, the woman wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, the man adjusting his belt. He sighed, wondering how the hell he was going to survive the rest of this curfew.

Fun, Mutt had said.

It sure didn’t feel like fun.

Mutt laughs, asking the guy if he wants some help, obviously only to get Tanner to lose his shit again, but this time he doesn't fall for it. As they keep asking, she asks how come, and he says he knows she wouldn't actually lower herself to that level, not even high. And he's right.

The deeper Tanner and Mutt ventured into the Red Light District, the seedier it became. The streets narrowed into twisted alleys that reeked of spilled booze, vomit, and the acrid scent of burning drugs. The glow of neon signs became harsher, casting the world in shades of sickly pink and green, while the noise of the district—laughter, shouting, the low hum of deals being made—filled the air like a constant, oppressive buzz.

Tanner’s stomach churned with every step, his eyes darting between the shadowy figures leaning against crumbling walls, watching them with either disinterest or thinly veiled curiosity. He tugged his jacket closer, feeling exposed, like they were walking through a den of predators.

Mutt, on the other hand, was thriving in the chaos. She was practically skipping, still puffing lazily on her methane pipe as they turned into a particularly dark and narrow alley. The shadows clung to the corners here, and Tanner could feel the weight of every eye on them.

Then, from up ahead, a disgusting, rhythmic sound filled the alley.

Fap-fap-fap.

Tanner’s eyes widened in horror as the noise grew louder, unmistakable now. He could see a figure crouched in the shadows, jerking wildly at something glowing in his hands. The guy’s breathing was heavy, ragged, and then Tanner caught sight of it: a digi-magazine, flickering with the unmistakable image of her—Austerline. The magnate's daughter. Of course. The head of the largest methane refinery on Mars, and his precious Austerline, who had a penchant for making explicit content. Because, naturally, Mars’s underworld wouldn’t be complete without the ruling elite profiting off their own scandal.

“Fuck yeah! Come to daddy, Austerline!” the man groaned, his face twisted in depraved ecstasy as he neared the edge. The magazine's holographic display flickered, showing Austerline in some compromising pose, doing God-knows-what to someone Tanner didn’t want to think about.

Tanner’s jaw clenched, his hands balling into fists as he felt the sudden, overwhelming urge to get the hell out of this alley. What the hell are we even doing here?

But of course, Mutt burst into laughter.

“Yo, buddy!” she called out, her voice full of wicked amusement. “You want some help with that? Or are you good solo?”

The guy didn’t stop, his focus entirely on the digi-magazine as he let out a guttural moan, his movements getting faster. Tanner’s face turned bright red as he felt his pulse quicken. “Mutt, for God’s sake—”

But she was having way too much fun. “C’mon, Captain,” she said between giggles, slapping his shoulder. “I’m just being a good Samaritan. Dude looks like he’s about to bust an artery.”

Tanner ground his teeth together, forcing himself to breathe. She’s doing this to rile you up. Don’t fall for it. Not again.

He glared at Mutt, who was watching him with expectant eyes, waiting for him to explode. But this time, he didn’t take the bait. “You done?” he asked, his voice surprisingly calm given the circumstances.

Mutt’s grin faltered for a second, her blue eyes narrowing in playful suspicion. “What’s this? No yelling? No ‘Mutt, what the hell is wrong with you’?”

Tanner shook his head, managing a tired smile as they passed the man, who finally groaned, his body shuddering in the aftermath of his solo performance. Tanner made a point of not looking as they passed by. “Nope,” he said. “I’m not falling for it this time. I know you.”

Mutt tilted her head, clearly intrigued. “Yeah? And what exactly do you think you know, Captain?”

“I know,” Tanner said, his voice steady as they continued down the alley, the neon lights flickering like dying stars above them, “that you wouldn’t lower yourself to that level. Not even when you’re high as a kite.”

Mutt blinked, taken aback for a split second. The grin on her face wavered, just barely, before she regained her composure. “Well, shit, Captain. Didn’t know you had that much faith in me.” She took another drag from her pipe, the vapor escaping her lips as she raised an eyebrow at him. “You’re right, though. I wouldn’t. That dude? Way too greasy. I’ve got standards.”

Tanner chuckled softly, surprising himself with how relaxed he felt despite the absolute disaster that surrounded them. The alley opened up into a wider street, where the neon lights became brighter and the crowd thicker. Prostitutes leaned out of brothel windows, advertising their services in loud, sultry voices. Dealers stood on every corner, haggling prices for whatever drug was trending that week. This was Mars’s true underbelly, far removed from the political machinations of the MCA, and yet fueled by it.

“See?” Mutt said, clapping Tanner on the back. “Told you this place wasn’t so bad. A little messy, sure, but fun. You could use some of that.”

Tanner sighed, glancing around at the dilapidated buildings and the desperate faces of the people trapped in the cycle of vice. Fun. That wasn’t the word he’d use, but at least he’d managed to survive Mutt in the Red Light District without losing his mind—this time.

“Yeah,” he muttered, staring down at the cracked pavement as they walked, the hum of the city’s depravity following them. “Fun.”

I want him to sit on a bench, or what's left for one. "Give me that." He says, as he takes a huff himself. Feels weird, definitely methane based. "Mutt, where do you think we should go next? Think we should hit good ol' home, Earth?"

Tanner’s feet felt heavy as they wandered deeper into the Red Light District, his mind reeling from the sensory overload. The haze of cheap neon and grime mixed with the raw, metallic stench of Mars’s industrial underbelly, creating a suffocating atmosphere that gnawed at him. It was like stepping into the belly of a beast, where desperation and indulgence were the only currencies that mattered.

They rounded a corner, and Tanner spotted what was left of an old bench—just rusted metal slats, some of them bent out of shape. Without a word, he slumped down onto it, the worn metal creaking under his weight. He rested his elbows on his knees, rubbing his temples, trying to clear the fog in his mind.

Mutt leaned against a cracked wall nearby, idly toying with her pipe, taking another deep drag before exhaling the glowing methane vapor into the air. She seemed completely at home in this environment, her sharp blue eyes scanning the street as if it was just another day in paradise.

"Give me that," Tanner said suddenly, his voice low and tired, nodding toward the pipe in her hand.

Mutt blinked, raising an eyebrow as she looked at him, a crooked grin slowly spreading across her face. “You serious, Captain? Thought you were Mr. ‘Keep It Clean’.”

Tanner sighed, rubbing the back of his neck before extending his hand. “I think I’ve earned it. Just... let me try.”

Mutt snorted but handed him the pipe. “Alright, but don’t come crying to me when your head feels like it’s spinning in four different directions. This shit’s potent.”

Tanner took the pipe, feeling its weight in his hand, the surface still warm from Mutt’s grip. He hesitated for a moment, then brought it to his lips and took a deep, deliberate huff. The vapor burned on the way down, and for a moment, his chest tightened as the methane-based drug coursed through his system.

His vision swam, the world around him taking on a strange, fuzzy quality. The neon lights overhead seemed to pulse with an unnatural rhythm, like the whole street was breathing in tandem with him. He exhaled, and the glowing vapor escaped his lips, swirling lazily into the air before dissipating into nothing.

"Feels weird," he muttered, coughing lightly as the drug settled into his bloodstream. It wasn’t an unpleasant feeling, but it wasn’t what he expected, either. His thoughts slowed down, the weight of his responsibilities and worries slipping away, leaving him in a strange, detached state. “Definitely methane-based. Why do I feel like I’m floating?”

Mutt chuckled, folding her arms across her chest as she watched him with amusement. “Told ya. That stuff’s got a kick, doesn’t it? Numbs you right up.” She sat down on the edge of a broken planter across from him, her eyes gleaming as she leaned forward slightly. “Now you know why I love it.”

Tanner leaned back, closing his eyes for a moment, letting the sensation wash over him. For the first time in a while, he felt... quiet. Like the chaos of his life was muted, distant. He took a deep breath, then opened his eyes again, staring up at the swirling lights above the district.

“Mutt,” he said after a moment, his voice quieter, softer than usual. “Where do you think we should go next?”

Mutt tilted her head, resting her elbows on her knees. “What, after this little Mars adventure?”

“Yeah.” Tanner stared at the ground, feeling the rusted slats of the bench digging into his back. “I mean... we could head back to Psyche. It’s safe there, more or less. Or...” His voice trailed off, the fog in his mind thickening as the drug took hold. He swallowed, then looked at her, a small, thoughtful smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Think we should hit good ol’ home? Earth?”

The question hung in the air for a moment, and Mutt’s expression shifted. Her playful smirk faded, replaced by something more contemplative. She took another drag from her pipe, the vapor curling between her lips before she spoke.

“Earth, huh?” she said, her voice softer now, almost thoughtful. “You really wanna go back there? Thought you left that rock behind for a reason.”

Tanner shrugged, leaning forward, resting his arms on his knees. “I did. But... I don’t know. It’s still home, right? I mean, no matter where we go, we can’t really shake it. There’s a part of me that still... misses it. You ever feel that?”

Mutt snorted, though it lacked her usual bite. “Not really. Old Earth’s a shithole now. 15 billion people packed in like sardines, all clawing at each other to survive. The MCA’s breathing down everyone’s neck, and the Plutocracy doesn’t give a damn as long as they get their cut. It’s not exactly a paradise.” She paused, staring off into the distance, her eyes narrowing slightly. “But... yeah, I get it. It’s where everything started. Hard to shake that.”

Tanner nodded, the haze of the drug making his thoughts feel far-off and disconnected, like they were coming from someone else. “Yeah. Maybe that’s why I keep thinking about it. I don’t know, Mutt. Sometimes, it just feels like no matter where we go—Mars, Psyche, the Belt—it’s all the same. We’re just... running.”

Mutt’s gaze softened, and for once, she didn’t crack a joke. She leaned back, staring up at the flickering lights overhead. “Running’s the only thing we know how to do, Captain. You stop running, you stop moving, and someone’s gonna catch you. And when they do...” She trailed off, her voice laced with a kind of bitter understanding that Tanner had never heard from her before. “Well, you know how it goes.”

They sat in silence for a moment, the sounds of the district swirling around them—laughter, the hiss of cheap drugs being inhaled, the distant thrum of music from the seedy bars. It was chaotic, loud, and dirty. But somehow, sitting there on that broken bench, the world felt still.

Tanner took another huff from the pipe, exhaling slowly as he closed his eyes again. “Maybe we’ll head back. Maybe we won’t. But for now...” He glanced over at Mutt, the haze in his mind making everything seem a little less urgent, a little less sharp. “I guess we’ll just keep moving. Like we always do.”

Mutt chuckled softly, blowing out a cloud of vapor. “Damn straight, Captain. Now you’re starting to sound like a real spacer.”

Tanner smiled faintly, letting the strange, floating sensation wash over him once more. Maybe Mutt was right. Maybe running was the only thing they knew how to do. But for now, in the neon-lit depths of Mars’s underworld, they could afford to stop for just a little while longer.
